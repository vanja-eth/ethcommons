**EthCommons** is a community-driven, not-for-profit, educational hub dedicated to leveraging the Ethereum blockchain for social good. We focus on empowering individuals and organizations worldwide, particularly those who can benefit most from blockchain technology, to explore and realize their potential in a global and inclusive digital economy.

## About Ethereum Commons

EthCommons is built on the foundation that public, general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum enable the creation of next-generation enterprises. These platforms provide permissionless access to digital ownership, facilitating a transparent, permissionless, and trustless economic environment.

### Our Vision

"Ethereum for Social Good" encapsulates our mission to harness Ethereum to support global inclusivity in the digital economy, particularly benefiting those in less developed regions or marginalized communities.
